    "ANSWER- The key tasks involved in getting ready to work with machine learning modeling are:\n",
    "i) Data collection:Defining the problem and assembling a dataset.\n",
    "ii) Data preparation:Preparing your data.\n",
    "iii) Choosing a Model.\n",
    "iv) Training the model:Developing a model that does better than a baseline.\n",

    "# 2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- The different forms of data used in machine learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Numerical data: Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers.Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "Numerical data can be characterized by continuous or discrete data. Continuous data can assume any value within a range whereas discrete data has distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) Categorical data: Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Time series data: Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Text data: Text data is basically just words. A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Numeric vs. categorical attributes:\n",
    "  .Numerical data are values obtained for quantitative variable, and carries a sense of magnitude related to the context of the   variable (hence, they are always numbers or symbols carrying a numerical value).\n",

    ".Feature selection you just select a subset of the original feature set, without any manipulation of the data on the other hand.\n",

    ".Dimensionality reduction is typically choosing a new representation within which you can describe most but not all of the variance within your data, thereby retaining the relevant information, while reducing theamount of information necessary to represent it."

    "ANSWER- \n",
    "1. The histogram: A Histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into user-specified ranges. Similar in appearance to a bar graph, the histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.\n",

The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PCA (Personal Computer Aid): Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction of the large data set. Reducing the number of components or features costs some accuracy and on the other hand, it makes the large data set simpler, easy to explore and visualize."
